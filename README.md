# GuessingGame
"Number Guessing Game" is an interactive web-based app built using Python and Streamlit. Players are challenged to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The app provides instant feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. It tracks the number of attempts and allows users to restart the game seamlessly.
